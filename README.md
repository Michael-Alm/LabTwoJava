Possible Error: 
1. If you get the warning - JDK "openjdk-23" is missing - You should have an option to download the jdk and once it is done the program should be able to run :D
2. There was a legal warning that popped up when testing on my laptop from the beginning of the semster. I think this is because when I installed InteliJ on my current laptop a new JDK was available for download. It should hopefully not affect the program.

Runable Files:
1. EventTester.java - runs part one of lab 2
2. EventPlanner.java - runs part two of lab 2 (GUI)

Input Tips:
1. The dates are shown as (YYYY-MM-DD) meaning year, month and date. Along with this is the HH:MM which represents Hour and minute however it is in 24 hour format.
2. Example: "2024-09-25 15:00" - is the same as September 25 2024 at 3pm (for the java class)
